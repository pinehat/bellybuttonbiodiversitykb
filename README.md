A project to build an interactive dashboard to explore the datasets of Belly Button Biodiversity, a study launched in 2011 by researchers with the Public Science Lab (http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/). The aim of this study is "to investigate the microbes inhabiting our navels and the factors that might influence the microscopic life calling this protected, moist patch of skin home."  This application was deployed to Heroku and can be view there at https://bellybuttonbiodiversitykb.herokuapp.com.
